# Machine Coding Problem: Todo List App

## Problem Statement

Build a Todo List application using React with the following features:

### Requirements:
1. **Add Todo**: Users should be able to add new todos by typing in an input field and pressing Enter or clicking an "Add" button.
2. **Display Todos**: Show all todos in a list format.
3. **Toggle Complete**: Each todo should have a checkbox to mark it as complete/incomplete. Completed todos should be visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough text).
4. **Delete Todo**: Each todo should have a delete button to remove it from the list.
5. **Edit Todo**: Allow users to edit existing todos by clicking an edit button, which should make the text editable.
6. **Filter Todos**: Provide buttons to filter todos by status:
   - All: Show all todos
   - Active: Show only incomplete todos
   - Completed: Show only completed todos
7. **Clear Completed**: A button to remove all completed todos at once.

### Technical Requirements:
- Use React functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect if needed).
- Manage state locally (no backend required).
- Style the application with CSS (basic styling is fine).
- Ensure the app is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

### Bonus Features (Optional):
- Persist todos in localStorage so they remain after page refresh.
- Add due dates to todos.
- Add categories/tags to todos.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Functionality: All required features work correctly.
- Code Quality: Clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- UI/UX: Intuitive user interface.
- Edge Cases: Handle empty inputs, duplicate todos, etc.

### Getting Started:
1. The project is set up with Vite and React.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. Implement the features in `src/App.jsx` and other components as needed.
4. Style in `src/App.css` or create additional CSS files.

Good luck!
